## U.S.Alternative Fuel Stations 

+ ### Project background: 
Alternative fuels are any materials that can be used as fuels, other than conventional fuels. Common alternative fuels include Compressed Natural Gas, Electric, Hydrogen, and Liquefied Natural Gas. Currently, government and private-sector vehicle fleets are the primary users for most of these fuels and vehicles, but individual consumers are increasingly interested in them. Using alternative fuels and advanced vehicles instead of conventional fuels and vehicles helps the United States conserve fuel and lower vehicle emissions. 

+ ### Web Application summary: 
This Application privides two main goals.

1. This Alternative Fuel Calculator Web Application helps eco-friendly drivers find nearby alternative fuel stations and calculate the estimated price of alternative fuels they need to get to their destinations.
- Interactive Map: Find nearby alternative fuel stations in the map
- Calculator: Calculate estimated price the type and size of your fuel
- Navigator: Display distance and time between the origin and destination

2. This app also contains an analytics report that shows some preliminary data analysis results to help people learn more about how alternative fuel is adapted in the U.S. 
- Fuel type by State
- Animation of the growth of alternative fuel
- Access type by fuel type
